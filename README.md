**Pico ORM**, when simple data require simple data management.
 
### How to? (short version)

```clojure
(ns example
  (:require
    [cellar.core :as db]
    [cellar.config :as cfg]))

;; providing db settings
(cfg/-db-settings>
  {:classname   "org.h2.Driver"
   :subprotocol "h2:mem"
   :subname     "demo;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1"
   :user        "sa"
   :password    ""})

;; creating a new table
(db/deftable cellar-shelves
             :conditional!
             [[:id "BIGINT"]
              [:shelve-height "BIGINT"]
              [:shelve-content "VARCHAR(64)"]])
;; OR
(db/deftable cellar-shelves
             :conditional!
             {:id             "BIGINT"
              :shelve-height  "BIGINT"
              :shelve-content "VARCHAR(64)"})
;; OR
(db/deftable cellar-shelves
             :conditional!
             {:id             :bigint
              :shelve-height  :bigint
              :shelve-content :varchar64})

;; inserting new record
(db/insert! :cellar-shelves
            {:id             1
             :shelve-height  2
             :shelve-content "One small lib"})
;; => {:id 1 :shelve-height 2 :shelve-content "One small lib"}

;; let's check if new record exists
(db/exists? :cellar-shelves {:id 1})
;; => true ; indeed, it was just created

(db/update! :cellar-shelves
            {:shelve-height 3}
            {:id 1})
;; => 1 ; only one record was updated

(db/delete! :cellar-shelves
            {:id 1})
;; => 1 ; only one record was deleted
```

### why?
There are plenty of ORM's out there, but mostly they are much larger. 
For small, close to pet-projects, it is overkill to use anything larger, than this ORM.

Mainly it is designed and created for my private pet-projects.

### What's the deal with `-foo>` and `<foo-`
Code notations of this project:

* `-foo>` - alias for `set foo`
* `<foo-` - alias for `get foo`
* `-foo`  - private function
* `foo!`  - state altering function
* `foo!!` - heavy state altering function

###### underscore is never used!

### Future plans
1. Add table specific columns and values transformers
2. Batch insert/delete
3. Fields emitting fn's
4. Add '?', '!', '*' support
5. Add logs and tests
